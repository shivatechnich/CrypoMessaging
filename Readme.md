Alice is the server code.
Bob is the client code.
This code has to be executed in the same folder in which HW1PlaintextTest.txt, SharedSecretKey.txt files are present
The folder needs to have libzmq, cppzmq and libtomcrypt libraries in it.
Need to run Bob first and then Alice.
Once the code is run, it will create TheCiphertext.txt,BobPlaintext.txt and Bob_h.txt text files are created.
Please let me know if there are any issues while running the code.
